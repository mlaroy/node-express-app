#Node app with Express and MongoDB

As part of a Node.js course at BCIT, I developed this little app using Node and Express to show a list of sample real estate properties, and add to it with a form hitting an API route. The front end implementation just uses jQuery for now, but a later version might include React.

## Basic Requirements

This app was built using Node version 6.9.x, so if you are running a version manager, try `nvm use 6.9.1` if you have it installed already.

Next, run `npm install` to install the app dependencies.

To view the project, run `npm start` and see the app at http://localhost:3000
